# Code Elevation Skill

## Purpose

Transform startup-stage patterns into enterprise-grade implementations.

## Pattern Categories

### State Management

- Startup: Props drilling, scattered state
- Enterprise: Centralized state management
- See: `resources/patterns.md#state`

### Error Handling

- Startup: try-catch with console.log
- Enterprise: Structured errors with monitoring
- See: `resources/patterns.md#errors`

### API Design

- Startup: Mixed conventions
- Enterprise: Consistent GraphQL with types
- See: `resources/patterns.md#api`

## Usage

1. Identify current patterns in code
2. Reference `resources/patterns.md` for alternatives
3. Suggest migration path with citations
